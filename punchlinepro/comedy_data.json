I tried to surprise him by learning German. We hadn't seen each other for a while, and because he speaks German, I thought I was gonna surprise him on the trip, you know? I went on Duolingo, did a bunch of studying, and I got to Germany, got over there and practiced, the whole thing, got to Switzerland and was like, \"This is it.\" I was ready, like, \"I'm gonna surprise my dad.\" I planned to get to his house, knock on the door. He was gonna open it and be surprised like, \"Trevor!\" Then I would be like, \"<i>Papa! Ich sprechen Deutsch!</i>\" He was gonna be like… And be like… It was gonna be a whole thing. I had it all planned out. Didn't go according to plan. I got there. He was surprised. He was happy. But as soon as I spoke, like, \"<i>Papa! Ich sprechen Deutsch!</i>\" He was like, \"Don't do that.

      "explanation": "这个段子探讨了女性在日常互动中面临的性别歧视与自我怀疑。喜剧演员凯瑟琳·科恩通过描述在餐厅点餐的简单场景，揭示了许多女性在公共场合经常遇到的心理体验。当餐厅员工简单询问她是否确定要选择最辣的酱料时，她的内心立即进入过度分析模式，怀疑自己是否有资格做决定，并自嘲地将自己描述为'只会想耳环和鞋子的小女孩'和'胸部比较大的小宝宝'。这种内心独白反映了社会对女性的刻板印象如何内化为自我怀疑，即使在点餐这样的简单决定中也会出现。段子最后'彻底断片'和'我刚刚说了烦人的话吗？'的转折，进一步强化了女性常常担心自己是否太多话、太烦人、太不专业的社会压力。通过夸张的内心对白，段子既幽默又令人反思性别期望如何塑造日常体验。",
